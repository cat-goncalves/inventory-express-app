## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

This project uses Node.js and the Express.js framework to create a full-stack CRUD inventory manafement system app. The user enters an item and its price into the database. The manamgement system automatically initializes the  quantity to be 1 unit and allows the user to update the quantity of units and caculate the total cost as needed

## Lessons Learned:
This project was largely inspired by my previous experience in wine sales, where we performed inventory weekly and were constantly wishing we had a more efficient way to dynamically update the total cost of all wines in stock. As inventory management systems are used in many different industries, I felt this could be a helpful tool to create while also making it flexible enough to be used outside of the wine industry. I took a bit of a different approach with this project, by designing the update feature to include a user input number. This was a bit of an added challenge beyond click-events, and helped me to expand my understanding of building more flexible CRUD apps
